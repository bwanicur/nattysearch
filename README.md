## Natty Search

There are a few major pet rescue web services (and hopefully more to come) that are used by rescue organizations. These services provide an API, and in the case of Rescue Groups, provide iFrame solutions also.  This often results in rescue organizaitons having websites that are not great at searching pet data or sharing pet data online with friends, etc....

Natty Search is an attempt to wrap those APIs and provide an user friendly pet-searching application.


### Tech Stack

* Ruby on Rails
* ReactJS (embedded into Rails)
* Postgresql

For our MVP, we will just create a responsive site that can render in mobile also.  This might be good enough for the long term also.  The UI should be very simple.
